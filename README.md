In this project I implemented a Backend API to manage a restaurant orders.

Build RESTful api - with node.js, express, MongoDB, Postman, Virtual Studio Code

[Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

[Express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html)

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

### Server Functionality
##### The API support the next functionality:
- Save new order
- Get all orders from the last day
- Unit tests

More functionality:
- Get all items, Create item, Get item
- Get all orders, Create order, Get order, Deleted orders


### Usage
1. Download this project to your computer
```sh
git clone https://github.com/orti10/-Yammie-Restaurant.git
cd -Yammie-Restaurant
npm init
```

2. Install all dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

3. Run the project
```sh

4. At this point you can go to Postman to your localhost: http://localhost:2000 (2000 or other, depends on where the server is listening)
and run request to check/add information to the database
